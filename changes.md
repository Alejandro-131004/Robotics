# Project Evolution Summary: Advanced Training & Analysis Features

This document outlines the major new features and capabilities introduced to the robot training framework since June 11th. The focus has shifted from initial bug fixes to building a more intelligent, flexible, and insightful training pipeline.

### 1. Advanced Checkpoint & Curriculum Management
The training workflow is no longer linear. It now incorporates intelligent features that provide greater control and ensure the model's robustness.

- **Selectable Start Stage:** When loading a checkpoint, you can now choose to either continue from the last saved stage or restart training from any previous stage. The training history is automatically pruned to reflect this choice, ensuring the final performance graph is accurate.
- **"Refresh Training" & Retraining Queue:** A new "Refresh Training" option was introduced. When activated, it re-evaluates the current population's performance on all previously passed stages. Any stage where the success rate has dropped below the required threshold is automatically added to a "retraining queue." The system will then pause the main curriculum to retrain the population on these specific stages until they are mastered again, preventing skill regression.

### 2. New In-Depth Performance Analysis Tools
To gain a deeper understanding of the training results, new analysis scripts have been created.

- **Population Performance Heatmap:** A new script, `evaluation/analyze_population_performance.py`, was developed. It loads a final population from a checkpoint and runs every individual through all the completed training stages. The result is a detailed heatmap visualizing the fitness score of each individual on each stage, making it easy to spot specialists, generalists, and weaknesses in the final population.


### 3. Foundational Optimizations & Bug Fixes
These earlier changes paved the way for the more advanced features:
- **Map Generation Speed-Up:** Implemented batch creation of simulation objects (`Group` node) and reduced simulation steps, drastically decreasing map loading times.
- **Curriculum Redefinition:** The training curriculum was refocused to remove the complexity of obstacles and instead emphasize advanced navigation through progressively tighter and more complex curves.
- **Initial Bug Squashing:** Resolved a series of `AttributeError`, `ImportError`, and `ValueError` issues to stabilize the core code.
